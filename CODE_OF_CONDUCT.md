## ReactVision Code of Conduct

### Our Commitment

At ReactVision, we are committed to fostering a community where growth, transparency, integrity, and continuous learning are at the forefront. We believe in creating an environment that is welcoming and supportive for all, irrespective of individual differences such as age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are dedicated to building a community that not only respects diversity but also actively contributes to an inclusive, positive, and educational atmosphere.

### Our Pledge

In alignment with our ethos, we encourage the following behaviors:

- Exhibiting empathy and kindness toward others.
- Respecting diverse viewpoints and experiences, recognizing the value they add to our community.
- Providing and receiving constructive feedback in a positive and supportive manner.
- Acknowledging and learning from mistakes, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than failures.
- Prioritizing collective well-being and growth over individual interests.
- Upholding a standard of transparency in actions and decisions.

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Disrespectful or derogatory comments, trolling, and personal or political attacks.
- Harassment in any form, either publicly or privately.
- Disclosing others' private information without explicit consent.
- Any professional conduct deemed inappropriate or disruptive.

### Responsibility and Enforcement

Our ReactVision leaders and project maintainers are charged with upholding and enforcing these standards. They will take appropriate and equitable action against any conduct that is deemed harmful, disruptive, or inconsistent with the principles of our community.

These leaders have the authority to moderate, remove, or edit any contributions that are not in alignment with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate their rationale for moderation decisions when necessary.

### Applicability

This Code of Conduct is applicable in all ReactVision community spaces, as well as in instances where an individual is officially representing ReactVision in public forums.

### Reporting and Enforcement Procedure

Concerns or incidents of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the ReactVision enforcement team at [reactvision@edorantes.com](mailto:reactvision@edorantes.com). All reports will be evaluated and investigated in a fair and timely manner.

Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in consequences enforced by ReactVision leadership, which may include temporary or permanent exclusion from community spaces.

### Customization and Attribution

This Code of Conduct has been tailored to reflect the values and ethos of ReactVision, inspired by and adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 ([Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)). Our adaptation emphasizes our commitment to growth, learning, and accountability within a respectful and inclusive community.
